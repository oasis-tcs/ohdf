Members of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ohdf/">OASIS Heimdall Data Format (OHDF) TC</a> create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository as part of the TC's chartered work (__i.e.__, the program of work and deliverables described in its <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ohdf/charter.php">charter</a>).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work">GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work</a>, are governed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">TC Process</a>, <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr">IPR Policy</a>, and other policies. While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories">OASIS Open Repositories</a>, which are used for development of open source <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses">licensed</a> content.

## Description

The OHDF TC's goal is to develop a common format for exchanging normalized security data between cybersecurity tools. A standard vendor-agnostic data format will support cybersecurity product interoperability without having to create customized integrations.

Security tools typically generate data in unique formats that require multiple dashboards and utilities to review. This leads to a time-consuming process for completing security assessments, data in disparate locations and inconsistent semantics of data elements across formats.

In addition, few security tools provide context to relevant compliance standards for comparison across security tools.

OHDF provides a common data exchange format that:

- Enables the consistent integration, aggregation, and analysis of security data from all available sources
- Preserves data integrity with original source data
- Maximizes interoperability and data sharing
Facilitates the transformation and transport of data between security/management processes or technologies
- Allows for the mapping and enrichment of security data to relevant compliance standards (GDPR, NIST SP 800-53, PCI-DSS, etc.)

The TC will update OHDF as industry needs evolve.

Numerous stakeholders and adopters can benefit from the work of the OHDF TC:

- For Commercial and Vendor Cybersecurity Partners, OHDF defines a standardized, interoperable target format that vendor tools can consume across their customer base consistently and that is easily managed within the product lifecycle.

- For the Open Source Community, OHDF enables easy integration with commercial solutions without the need for direct partnerships.
For Government Agencies, OHDF can streamline business processes by having a standard, open source, machine-readable format for all security data.

- For Academia, OHDF offers a structured way to communicate and enhance research findings throughout the security community.

- For Corporate and Federal CISOs/CIOs, OHDF can increase visibility across the enterprise by taking advantage of normalized security data
in a standard format that supports risk information interoperability from a broad range of inputs to support security risk decision-making.

- For Security Engineers, OHDF can reduce resource requirements for multiple security data types by standardizing formatting across disparate security tools.

- For Risk Managers, OHDF can improve decision making by using a standardized format to facilitate automation,
standardize communication requirements, and inform risk-based analysis.

- For DevSecOps/Software Engineers, OHDF can streamline CI/CD processes by leveraging a standardized format to collate/aggregate
normalized security data to support automated and continuous security processes.
