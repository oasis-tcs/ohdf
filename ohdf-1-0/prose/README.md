# OHDF v1.0 Specification Prose Source Folder

This folder provides a place for development of the 
[OHDF v1.0 specification prose](ohdf-v1-editor-draft.md).

Note:
> The currently present markdown file, styles, and images have been derived from
> the current starter package of another OASIS TC (received on 2023-MAY-18)
> from OASIS administration (Paul Knight).
> When starting the real editorial work the TC will have to request a specific
> markdown template for the workproduct.
> The rationale for providing this template is to show how the boilerplate
> looks like so that everyone can easily see how our "spec-to-be" will fit in.
