# Meeting Minutes of the OASIS ODHF TC

The meeting minutes are in the text format markdown with github extensions (mostly table).

The file names indicate the date of the meeting in ISO-8601 format: `YYYY-mm-dd.md`
with the usual meaning of the placeholders for (Y)ear, (m)onth, and (d)ay.

There is a template to ease minute taking, reviewing, and referencing alike.

The local path to the template is [template/YYYY-mm-dd.md](template/YYYY-mm-dd.md).
