  - Open call for other suggestions from TC
  - Resolves open PR on [Seed Contribution InSpecJS Schemas](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/ohdf/pull/4)
- Develop the next data elements to be established for OHDF v1.0 draft
  - Current suggestions:
    - "Target Data" - the system to which the OHDF data pertains
    - "Overall Control Status" - dictates the "final" state of the control after all post-processing (attestations, waivers, etc.) is applied; can be used to override control state via attestations and waivers
    - "Run Identifier" - a UUID of some kind to differentiate the same OHDF-formatted scan run against the same target multiple times
      - Resolves issues raised by users regarding OHDF not having any IDs for individual runs
    - "Adjudicated Control" - boolean which is flipped to True if the Overall Control Status was changed by an attestation or waiver
      - Resolves concerns that attestations and waivers could be a "thumb on the scale" that would not be clear from the OHDF data

## 4-3 Next datatype integration research

- Current suggestion: Integrating SBOM data into OHDF
- Open call for other suggestions from TC
